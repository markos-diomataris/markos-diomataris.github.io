Moving By Looking presents innovative methods for understanding and generating motion patterns through visual observation. This work explores how visual cues can be leveraged to create more intuitive and effective motion synthesis systems.

The approach focuses on extracting meaningful motion representations from visual data, enabling more natural and contextually aware motion generation across various applications and scenarios.
