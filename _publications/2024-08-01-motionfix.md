collection: publications
permalink: /publication/motionfix
excerpt: 'The MotionFix dataset is the first benchmark for 3D human motion editing from text. It contains triplets of source and target motions, and edit texts that describe the desired modification. Our dataset allows both training and evaluation of models for text-based motion editing. TMED is a conditional diffusion model trained on MotionFix to perform motion editing using both the source motion and the edit text.'

MotionFix introduces the first benchmark for text-driven 3D human motion editing, featuring a comprehensive dataset of motion triplets and corresponding edit descriptions. Our TMED (Text-based Motion Editing Diffusion) model leverages a Transformer Encoder Denoiser to perform precise motion modifications based on textual instructions.

The project demonstrates significant advances in controllable human motion synthesis, enabling fine-grained editing operations through natural language descriptions. This work opens new possibilities for intuitive motion design and animation workflows.
