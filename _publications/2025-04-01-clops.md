title: "Moving by Looking: Towards Vision-Driven Avatar Motion Generation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/clops
excerpt: 'Human-like motion requires Human-like perception. We create a human motion generation system, named CLOPS, that is purely driven by Vision. CLOPS is able to realistacally move in a scene and use egocentric vision in order to find a goal (red sphere). We achieve this by combining a data driven low level motion prior with a Q-Learning policy that effectively create a loop of visual perception and motion.'

Moving By Looking presents innovative methods for understanding and generating motion patterns through visual observation. This work explores how visual cues can be leveraged to create more intuitive and effective motion synthesis systems.

The approach focuses on extracting meaningful motion representations from visual data, enabling more natural and contextually aware motion generation across various applications and scenarios.
